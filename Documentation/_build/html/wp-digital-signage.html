<ul class="simple">
<li>Site runs on server.</li>
<li>App is installed on the device on which slider will be displayed.</li>
<li>The device connect with the server and fetch the necessary information needed for running the slider on the device.</li>
<li>The details of displays, group displays, events,floormaps and alerts are provided</li>
<li>Display table contains the displays of the device on which slider will be running, and the details are display’s id, name, location, mac, status etc.</li>
<li>Group displays contains the id of one or more displays. Grouping of the displays is done to avoid redundant settings.</li>
<li>Event manager is another table which contains the names of displays and group displays, it manages the time of the displays and group displays i.e which display will run in what time period and between what days..etc</li>
<li>Floormaps contains the name of the floormap and the image of the floormaps and the status of the floormap whether they are active or disabled.</li>
<li>Alerts is the table which contains the ids of displays and group displays and the email address and it uses the crontab to check whether display is working properly or not, and if not then a mail is send to the email address which is linked with the particular display.</li>
<li>One can add a new display, group, event, floormaps or alert, delete or edit the existing one.</li>

<h3><strong><u>Working</u></strong><a class="headerlink" href="#working" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Devices are registered with their mac address and the corresponding names on the server.</li>
<li>An app is installed on the device which will automatically run when the device is on.</li>
<li>The display fetches the corresponding information from the server and according to the slider name it fetches the images and displays the images on the screen between the given time.</li>
<li>The sliders are decided for every display hence the slider according to the particular display will be displayed on the device screen.</li>
<li>The device will run the slider and will generate the url which will contain the uid of the display and its uptime as query variables. This url is used to get the uptime of the display i.e the time since display is running.</li>
<li>The query variables are used to notify if display is working or not.</li>
<li>The uid and uptime is fetched and accordingly the upstatus of the display is set to 1 i.e the screen/display is working and last seen is set as per the current timestamp.</li>
<li>It checks the last seen of the display and calculates the difference between the current time of the server and the last seen of the display and if the difference is above the certain time then a relevant message is sent.</li>
<li>If device is not working i.e difference is above certain limit then it fetches the email id corresponding to that display to send the mail to the concerned person that particular display is not working.</li>
<li>The upstatus of the display is again set to 0 as the display stopped working.</li>
